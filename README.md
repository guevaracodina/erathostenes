## The Sieve of Eratosthenes
This program was inspired by the artwork:
Sieb des Eratosthenes (The Sieve of Eratosthenes) (1971) from  Rune Mields (German painter, b. 1935)
This recreation from her 9 panel artwork displays prime numbers as white dots. 
The left column displays numbers arranged in 89 columns, central column arrangement is 90 columns and right column 91.
The lower panel displays the firs numbers starting from 1, where the linear patterns are evident. The middle row starts from 1e6 and the upper row starts from 1e15, where prime numbers are more scarce and the pattern looks almost random.
